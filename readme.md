# Js-biglietto-treno
## Description
The program will have to ask the user the number of kilometers he wants to travel and the age of the passenger.
Based on this information you will have to calculate the total price of the trip, according to these rules:
- the ticket price is defined based on km (â‚¬0.21 per km)
- a 20% discount applies for minors
- a 40% discount applies for those over 65.
- The final price output must be put out in human form (with a maximum of two decimals, to indicate cents on the price). This will  require a little research.
